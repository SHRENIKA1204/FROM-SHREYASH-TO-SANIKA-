    <h1>Dear Sanu,</h1>
    <div class="message">
Sanu,

I donâ€™t even know how to start, because no words feel enough right now. Iâ€™ve replayed our fight in my head a hundred times, wishing I could take back the words I said. They were hurtful, careless, and the truth isâ€”I didnâ€™t mean them. Not even for a second. I let my emotions speak before my heart could, and for that, I am truly sorry.

Do you remember the little things? Because I do. Every single one.

Like those quiet, perfect days when we went out for a date eating burgers and laughed over the dumbest things. Or when weâ€™d click those silly photosâ€”some posed, some blurryâ€”but all so full of love. Those moments werenâ€™t just cute memories to me. They were home.

And Iâ€™ll never forget the day you came all the way to phaltan to surprise me on my birthday. That day was the best day ever. That memory still makes my heart ache, because it reminds me of how lucky I was, and still am, to have you in my life.

I miss us. I miss everything we were, and everything I still believe we can be.

Iâ€™m not perfectâ€”I make mistakes. But if you can find even a little space in your heart for me, I promise to grow, to listen, to never let ego stand in the way of our love again.

You mean more to me than I ever knew how to say. And now, I just hope this message reaches you with all the love and sincerity I feel.

No matter what happens, Iâ€™ll always be thankful for youâ€”for your love, your effort, and every memory you gave me.

I am sorry ðŸ¥º

Always Yours - 
Shreyash.
